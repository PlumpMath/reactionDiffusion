### Reaction Diffusion studies

This repository contains 2 apps that implements the reaction diffusion simulation developed by Gray-Scott.

The app `reactionDiffusionNaive` contains an openFramework sketch that implements the simulation as explained in the [Shiffman's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BV9ny785UNc). This implementation is slow (around 20FPS) but it is easy to understand.
The app `reactionDiffusionNaive` does the same but using FBOs and the ping-pong technique to improve performance. It is still a work in progress.

Both application comes with a GUI to try out differents presets
